# Introduction to Big Data with Spark and Hadoop 
## by IBM Skills Network


## Introduction to the Hadoop Ecosystem

In this module, you'll gain a fundamental understanding of the Apache Hadoop architecture, ecosystem, practices, and commonly used applications including Distributed File System (HDFS), MapReduce, HIVE and HBase. Gain practical skills in this module's lab when you launch a single node Hadoop cluster using Docker and run MapReduce jobs.


## Apache Spark

Build your skills when you turn your attention to the popular Apache Spark platform. Explore attribute and benefits of Apache Spark and distributed computing. You'll gain key insights about functional programming and Lambda functions. Explore Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs), Parallel Programming, resilience in Apache Spark and relate RDDs and Parallel Programming with Apache Spark. Dive into additional Apache Spark components and learn how Apache Spark scales with Big Data. Working with Big Data signals the need for working with queries, including structured queries using SQL. Learn about the functions, parts and benefits of Spark SQL and DataFrame queries, and discover how DataFrames work with SparkSQL.


## DataFrames and SparkSQL

Learn about Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs), their uses in Apache Spark, and RDD transformations and actions. You'll compare the use of datasets with Spark's latest data abstraction, DataFrames. You'll learn to identify and apply basic DataFrame operations. Explore Apache Spark SQL optimization. Learn how Spark SQL and memory optimization benefit from using Catalyst and Tungsten. Learn how to create a table view and apply data aggregation techniques. Fortify your skills guided via the hands-on lab.

## Development and Runtime Environment Options

Explore how Spark processes the requests that your application submits. Learn how you can track work using the Spark Application UI. Because Spark application work happens on the cluster, you need be able to identify Apache Cluster Managers, their components, benefits, and know how to connect with each cluster manager and how and when you might want to set up a local, standalone Spark instance. Next, learn about Apache Spark application submission, including use of Spark’s unified interface, ‘spark-submit’ and learn about options and dependencies. Developers now have the option of AIOps. Discover how to use Spark within AIOps and with Apache Spark application submission, including use of Spark’s unified interface, ‘spark-submit’, describe and apply options for submitting applications, identify external application dependency management techniques and list Spark Shell benefits. View and see recommended practices for Spark's static and dynamic configuration options. Round out your development knowledge with insights about Spark on Kubernetes. This module features hands-on Spark labs using IBM Cloud and Kubernetes.


## Monitoring & Tuning

Platforms and applications require monitoring and tuning to manage issues that inevitably happen. In this module you'll learn about connecting the Apache Spark user interface web server and using the same UI web server to manage application processes. Identify common Apache Spark application issues. Learn about debugging issues using the application UI and locating related log files. Discover and gain real-world knowledge about how Spark manages memory and processor resources via videos and in the available hands-on lab.
